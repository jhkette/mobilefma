I'm sorry, I missed alot of the last lessons for this course because of covid 19.  I'm in close contact
with someone who is high risk so as soon as it became an issue I stopped doing university and social stuff (ie before
goverment formally cancelled stuff.) I couldn't open the video for the last lesson and I did try! I'm not sure why this was - but I did email my questions
about FMA - so that was fine. I felt fine doing it as I did lectures/activities along with course.
